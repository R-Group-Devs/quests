# Quests
This repo stores self-contained tasks related to R Group projects that anyone can take on. 

In the future, we may use these tasks as:
1. Good tasks for more junior or part-time R Group members.
2. Bounties for new DAO contributors to start with in order to gain community trust.

**If you are not an R Group member, do NOT create issues in this repository!**
